All functional files in Milestone 2 were built with the aid of the provided framework
used during class on October 5, 2020.

To compile and run, open the solution in Visual studio 2019 and run from main.cpp. an
example level will be deserialized from json format, stored in the Resources folder.

If this software is not compiled on Windows 10 using Visual Studio 2019, I cannot
predict the results, though I see no reason why other recent versions of Visual
Studio should not work.

If the included external libraries (one directory up) and my basic provided textures 
are not included with the project, I cannot predict the results. Most likely linker 
errors and a failure to load the image.
Both should be present to compile the project.

I am currently in the process of reworking my actual final project code to not use GLFW.
